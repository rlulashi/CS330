How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I like to write out a pseduocode on a dry erase board and map out what I am looking to get from the code. In the case with this project, I like to break things down into smaller steps to make the overall 
creation process more manegable and less daunting and overwhelming. I was able to create a 3D environment with 3D shapes with a Phong light source and camera movement. I can work from this code to add 
more complex shapes and more lighting as my experience grows. I still struggle with circular or spherical shapes but once I master those, implementation will be exciting!


How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?


I was able to use vertex arrays to store points and vectors for multiple cubes, a plane, and cylinder to be represented in 3D. Actually seeing the array used in real time is incredibly rewarding once
I got a better understanding of OpenGL. Seeing how shapes are rendered in 3D changed my perspective on how to actually implement the shapes. For example, I still need improvement on how to transform a 
cylinder to be on its side rather than vertical to better represent different objects. It was fun once I gained better understanding of how the vertices and indices are plotted in a 3D space. Each 
milestone added upon the last which helped me feel more prepared to generate this 3D scene.

I found a big appreciation for game design and graphics doing this course, which in turn as I figure out where to go in my career after graduation may be game design. It was challenging, and I wouid be
lying if I said it was frustrating at times, however once I saw I could create even just a basic shape it made me excited for the possibility of much more.
